		<p><b>Warning: This review contains SPOILERS for Stranger Things season 2.</b></p>

		<p>It might be hard to remember in this age of Dustin gifs, Eleven cosplay and #Justice4Barb hashtags, but back in the summer of 2016, Stranger Things pretty much came out of nowhere.</p>

		<p>This quirky little show that no-one had heard much about launched to an unexpected level of success. A bona-fide sensation that soared almost by word of mouth alone, it permeated the public consciousness with its colourful characters, charming cast and affectionate aping of '80s film and TV classics.</p>

		<p>Now, 15 months on, things are different. Stranger Things returns with almost all the familiar elements in place – the cast, the soundtrack, the humour, the nightmarish imagery, and the references. (This follow-up is like Alien meets The Exorcist meets, obviously, a whole heap of Stephen King.)</p>

		<p>What it lacks, naturally enough, is novelty value, and so some of the immediate charm of its predecessor. But it compensates, mostly successfully, by expanding the world established in the first eight episodes.</p>

		<p>In particular, the absolutely storming final two episodes are a superb blend of emotion, action and quiet character moments, with a wonderfully sweet-natured epilogue that'll leave you hankering for season three.</p>

		<p>And the stage is already set. While there's no cliffhanger here akin to Will vomiting up a slug, enough lingering threads are left hanging – terrors still lurking in the Upside Down, the fate of Eight and her gang – to set up further adventures.</p>

		<p>Despite a few reservations, we're excited for more. Because while this Stranger Things might feel just that little bit more ordinary, it's only a little less impressive for it.</p>
